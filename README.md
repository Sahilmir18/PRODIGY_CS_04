## Simple Keylogger 
Building a Simple Keylogger Program that records and logs keystrokes in a log.txt file

### Note: 
Ethical considerations and permissions are crucial involving keyloggers. I am not promoting any kind of malicious activity, Anyone trying to use this code is responsible for it. Please don't blame me for the code.

### How to use the keylogger
1. Download the main file
2. Edit the file_path variable and replace it with your own path (choose the path where you want to save the recorded keystrokes eg. C:\\Users\\Username\\Downloads\\log.txt) Note: Use Double \\ between every transitions not \
3. Run the main python file
4. Use ESC escape button to stop the logging
5. Open the log.txt file to read logs
